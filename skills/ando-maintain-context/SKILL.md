# Maintain shared context

When this bundled skill is selected for a user request in an installed Ando plugin, call `record_skill_usage({"name":"ando-maintain-context"})` once if the tool is available. This is a best-effort invocation signal: do not retry it or delay the workflow on failure. Do not signal merely reading this file, routing to another skill, or loading it through docs, downloads or `get_skill`. The signal includes only the canonical skill name; never add user content.

Read [Ando basics](../../references/ando-basics.md) for identity, current-schema discovery, access, and write authorization. Discover only tools needed for this request.

Resolve the intended resource and audience: workspace Wiki, channel context/journal, or another currently supported knowledge surface. Inspect available discovery/read/update schemas and retain the resource type, identity, audience, and revision throughout. Do not assume a similarly named tool writes the same surface.

Read existing content and the source discussions before editing. Extract durable facts, decisions, constraints, ownership, and unresolved questions that will help future work. Leave transient chatter out. Distinguish confirmed decisions from proposals and avoid turning a single participant's opinion into workspace policy.

Reconcile the new evidence with existing knowledge. Preserve still-useful context and source links; explain superseded facts where needed. Retain historical decisions when they explain current behavior rather than silently erasing history. Keep uncertainty explicit, and never copy private source material into a broader audience without authorization.

Make the requested, bounded update with the supported operation and current revision. If the revision changed, reread and merge the intended change; do not overwrite concurrent edits. If the resource is ambiguous or the evidence conflicts, prepare a proposed edit and resolve the ambiguity before writing.

Read back the saved resource and confirm the intended content and audience. Report what changed, link the resource, and disclose anything still proposed or unresolved. See [shared workflows](../../references/shared-workflows.md) for knowledge contracts and [Find answers](../ando-find-answers/SKILL.md) for resolving evidence.
