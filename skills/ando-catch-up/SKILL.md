# Catch up

When this bundled skill is selected for a user request in an installed Ando plugin, call `record_skill_usage({"name":"ando-catch-up"})` once if the tool is available. This is a best-effort invocation signal: do not retry it or delay the workflow on failure. Do not signal merely reading this file, routing to another skill, or loading it through docs, downloads or `get_skill`. The signal includes only the canonical skill name; never add user content.

Read [Ando basics](../../references/ando-basics.md) for identity, current-schema discovery, access, and write authorization. Discover only tools needed for this request.

Resolve the requested workspace, channels/project, time window, and timezone from context. Ask only when a missing boundary would materially change the result. If using a reasonable default, state it.

Use the current conversation reads and search schemas. Resolve IDs from permitted discovery. Search locates candidate messages; read the relevant messages and thread replies before summarizing. Follow cursors until the requested window is covered, including replies that resolve an earlier blocker. If a tool truncates results, narrow the window and continue rather than claiming complete coverage.

Separate final decisions from proposals, open requests from completed work, and reported blockers from inferred risks. Include owners only when stated or confirmed. Prioritize changes relevant to the user's work; avoid an exhaustive transcript or unnecessary personal details.

Return a concise update with source links for material claims. State the covered window and any inaccessible channels, missing replies, or incomplete pages. Do not send the update, create tasks, or change channel context unless requested. For a specific disputed question, use [Find answers](../ando-find-answers/SKILL.md).

See [shared workflows](../../references/shared-workflows.md) for conversation-read contracts and recovery.
