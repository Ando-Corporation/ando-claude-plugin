# Coordinate work

When this bundled skill is selected for a user request in an installed Ando plugin, call `record_skill_usage({"name":"ando-coordinate-work"})` once if the tool is available. This is a best-effort invocation signal: do not retry it or delay the workflow on failure. Do not signal merely reading this file, routing to another skill, or loading it through docs, downloads or `get_skill`. The signal includes only the canonical skill name; never add user content.

Read [Ando basics](../../references/ando-basics.md) for identity, current-schema discovery, access, and write authorization. Discover only tools needed for this request.

Read the relevant discussion and replies. Extract explicit commitments, open requests, dependencies, deadlines, and stated owners. Preserve links to the supporting discussion. A suggestion is not an agreed assignment; the message author is not automatically the owner.

Resolve people and agents through current member discovery. Ask about ambiguous owners, dates/timezones, destinations, or authority before a dependent write. Do not ask again when the user has already supplied the answer or approved the exact action.

Before creating or updating tasks, inspect permitted existing tasks and search for the same outcome/source to avoid duplicates. Use the actual task contract, state, audience, and revision. On access denial, disclose the gap and provide proposed next steps rather than repeatedly inspecting inaccessible tasks. Do not convert a task-access failure into an unsupported mutation.

Within the requested scope, update an existing task or create one only if a creation operation is actually exposed and authorized. Preserve useful details and source context. Resolve revision conflicts by rereading current state. Do not infer permission to assign people, change deadlines, post messages, or create automations from a request for a plan.

For a draft, return the text in chat unless explicitly asked to save it in Ando. For an authorized send, resolve the destination and posting principal, send once, and return the actual message link. Reconcile uncertain write outcomes before retrying.

Report proposed versus saved changes clearly, with real owners and remaining decisions. See [shared workflows](../../references/shared-workflows.md) for task and sending contracts. Use [Catch up](../ando-catch-up/SKILL.md) for a read-only activity summary.
